# CS50p 2022
Harvard's CS50p is an introduction to programming using a language called Python and designate for students with or without prior programming experience whoâ€™d like to learn Python specifically.
> You can find more about the course [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).

I created this repository to save all my solutions for the problems proposed on the course. Every exercise got the maximum score on submission and all of them were stylized by [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).

My main motivation to take this course was because I was taking a Python class on my college and I wanted to practice some Python I learned in [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/). If you want to do the same as me or just learn Python, I highly recommend you to take this course.
> By the way I also have a repo of my CS50x solutions [here](https://github.com/isaacvicente/CS50x-2022/).

## Academic Honesty
> Please try to solve the problems before taking a look at any of my solutions. Only then will you have the best use of the course.
